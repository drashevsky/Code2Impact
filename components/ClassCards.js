Students will be taught the fundamentals of coding through the Java programming language, covering topics from primitive data types to classes to basic data structures like arrays. This course provides a bottom-up curriculum, supplemented by classic coding problems and project-based learning; moreover, students will be able to ask questions about class content and projects throughout the course and will receive guidance to help them ease into their first coding ventures.
